This file includes some information about the data from bitpanda.

## How to get assets for initial data?

With the api endpoint `https://api.bitpanda.com/v1/wallets` you get all your wallets.
If an new asset is in the app this will not be included so I need to try to buy this asset but don't do it, then a new wallet is created which can be check now.
